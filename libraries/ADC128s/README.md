# MODIFIED FOR REPEATED MEASUREMENTS



# FDC1004\_differential

This library provides functionality for differential measurement with the FDC1004 Capacitance to Digital Sensor. Based on library by Benjamin Shaya.
Designed for use with the Capacitive-Based Liquid Level Sensing Sensor Reference Design from Texas Instruments found at http://www.ti.com/tool/tida-00317

## Requirements

* Arduino
* FDC1004

## Limitations

* This library does not directly support single-ended measurement. Look for FDC1004-master created by Benjamin Shaya.
